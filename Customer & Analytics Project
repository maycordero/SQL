#I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data in this SQL.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM Bit_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product="iPhone"
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY Product, price
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1
;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product
;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT DISTINCT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
;
